    <p> 
        You can search the web and find all sorts of burger recipes, but when it comes to making a
        classic, no-frills, juicy hamburger, all you need is good quality meat, and a good burger 
        seasoning.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons paprika </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon brown sugar </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li> Cheese: cheddar cheese, or your favorite kind. </li>
        <li> Lettuce leaves.</li>
        <li> Tomato: beefsteak tomatoes are preferred, but any will work.</li>
        <li> Onion: Red or white onion, thinly sliced.</li>
        <li> Pickle slices.</li>
        <li> Condiments: ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, Thousand island dressing, 
             Ranch dressing, homemade Chick-fil A Sauce.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Prep seasoning.  Combine all spices in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Form patties. 
             Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch 
             thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink).
             Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. 
             Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li> Grill. Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, 
             indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is
             seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. 
             Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. 
             If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last minute of cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve. Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun, 
            with toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
